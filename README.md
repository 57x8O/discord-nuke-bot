**how to setup the bot**
- Download Python 3.5.3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-353/) THIS WILL NOT WORK ON ANY OTHER VERSIONS!!
- When you are downloading make sure to tick the "Add python 3.5 to PATH" THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DO NOT TICK IT!!
- After python is installed go to your CMD Prompt and type in **"pip install discord.py"** wait for it to install.
- Instll notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.4.html)
- Create a new notepad++
- Copy the bot's script and paste it into the notepad++
- Go here (https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and go to your bot and copy the token, if you don't have one, make one.
- Scroll down to the bottom of the script and paste the bots token into **"client.run("TOKEN")"** 
- After putting your bots token press on "file" and give a name to your bot
- Set the file into a python file (.py) and save the bot onto your desktop.
- Open up your CMD Prompt
- Type in **"cd desktop"**
- Then type in **"py -3.5 [BOTNAME].py"**
- Enjoy Nuking!
